# vtt-maps


## Disclaimer

Many map files in this repo are DungeonDraft files, and you will need a license to DungeonDraft to modify or re-render them.
Any map that is dubbed complete will be generated into an optimal-half output in the dd2vtt standard format. Once it's been outputted to that format,
it will have a preview image generated to accompany it. I am working on getting auto documentation and cataloging of each map available
in the README but for now you might have to go digging.
